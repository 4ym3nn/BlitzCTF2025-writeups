### Feature or Bug

Go to the bot and execute this payload:

```
/payload blitzctf flag type file
```

You will get some files that contain fake flags, and the real flag is in `payload.gif`.

Use the command:

```
cat payload.gif
```

And you will get the flag:

```
Blitz{h0w_w4s_th1s_n3w_f3atuR3?}
```
